Hello, 
My name is Dylan Pietrangelo. I am a 24 year old softmore at Brock University. I have studied throughout a few schools trying to decide what I would like to do in life. For now what I am studying now at Brock has fulfilled what I think I want to do in life.
I like hockey and my favourite team is the Pittsburgh Penguins in the NHL. I have played hockey my entire life ever since I started skating when I was 2 years old. Everything I have done in life has been for hockey but now that I have had 3 knee surgeries, life has a new plan for me. I look forward to seeing what my future has in store for me.
